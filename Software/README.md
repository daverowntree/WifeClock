Software stack consists of the basic Ardunio distribution plus the following libraries:  
DS1307RTC from http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_DS1307RTC.html (I think)  
Time  
Wire  
TimerOne from https://code.google.com/p/arduino-timerone/downloads/list  
(VirtualWire) Currently unused  
  
The external libraries are backed up here, in case the internet decides to purge them :D
