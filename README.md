# WifeClock
WifeClock project repo

Arduino stack based discrete LED 7-segment display clock with remote control.
Hardware for this first version, is prototyped with veroboard, using VeeCAD for layout and KiCAD for schematic design.

The display unit is modeled in OpenSCAD, and 3D printed on a Prusa i3 reprap.

Right now, I have been unable to find the time to get the radio operating, so the remote control hardware and software will be added to the repo when more complete.  Right now, the remote control is a mere push button on a long pair of wires :)
